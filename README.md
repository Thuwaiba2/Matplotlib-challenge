# Matplotlib-challenge
For this challenge, we were tasked with examining data derived from an animal study focused on identifying potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a frequently encountered type of skin cancer.

We had two datasets which were merged on Mouse Id, cleaned and then filtered to enable the anaysis.
We then performed summary statistics on the data using python. Pie charts and bar charts were created with the help of pandas and matplotlib.
The quartiles and interquartiles were also calculated and outliers identified. Boxplots were also created for further visualisation.
